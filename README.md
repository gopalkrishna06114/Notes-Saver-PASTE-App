# Notes Saver PASTE App

Developed a notes-taking web application using React.js with Vite for fast build and development. The app allows users to create, update, delete, copy, and view notes with titles. Notes are displayed in order of creation time on the Paste page and stored in localStorage for persistence. Designed with a simple and user-friendly interface for easy navigation.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
